# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning techniques. The predictive model takes into account various features related to properties, locations, and market trends to provide accurate and reliable price estimates. The goal is to assist real estate investors, homeowners, and industry professionals in making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

## Tech Stack

**1. [Python](https://www.python.org/):** The primary programming language for developing the prediction model and the overall project.

**2. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org):** A machine learning library used for building and training the predictive model.

**3. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/):** A data manipulation library for cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing the dataset.

**4. [NumPy](https://numpy.org):** A library for numerical computations, essential for handling arrays and matrices in the machine learning process.

**5. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html):** Visualization libraries used for creating informative plots and charts to better understand the data.

**6. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):** Interactive notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and model development.

## Usage
### Installation
*To use the real estate price prediction tool, follow these steps:*

**1. Clone the repository:**
```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-price-prediction.git
```
**2. Required Packages:** Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install them:
